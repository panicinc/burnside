Burnside
========

Panic's Burnside bridges Twitter to email and back.

It's particularly useful for companies that provide Twitter support. By handling @questions through an e-mail client, support agents can reply to tweets much quicker, answered tweets can be tracked by "Archiving" them or moving them to a subfolder, multiple agents can work out of the same mailbox (via IMAP), and an easily-searchable archive of tweets can be built over time.

**Burnside is intended for shell-level/e-mail server administrators**, and requires:

- Procmail (already working with user accounts on an IMAP/SMTP server)
- Cron
- Ruby
- SMTP server that supports "+" character recipient delimiter for sub-addressing

Other configurations may be possible based on your expertise.

How it works
------------

### Receiving
Periodically, the `fetch.rb` script is run and it generates an email for every new @mention. We'll assume you're fetching from a twitter account called `PanicGWTest` and sending mail to `twitter@panicburnside.org`. The generated email will have the following headers

	From: Example User <twitter+ohhaiexample@panicburnside.org>

We use username+token sub-addressing to provide a unique `from` address.

	To: twitter@panicburnside.org
	Message-ID: <1234567890@twitter-super_secret_auth_token.panicburnside.org>

The `Message-ID` contains the tweet status ID as well as the `auth_token`.

	Subject: Tweet from Example User (@ohhaiexample)
	X-Burnside: ignore
	
The `X-Burnside: ignore` header prevents our procmail recipe from processing these emails as they come in. This is necessary in the case where your `from` and `to` mailboxes are the same.

### Sending
When a reply to a tweet is received by procmail it's parsed by `tweet.rb` and a new tweet is generated. If the new tweet is over 140 characters then the email is bounced. If the `In-Reply-To` header doesn't contain the `auth_token` then the message is bounced. 

The format of the new tweet is

```ruby
#{@to} #{@reply_text} #{@sig}
```

`sig` is a space followed by an em-dash followed by the first letter of the sender's name in the `From:` header of the reply. Currently `tweet.rb` splits the reply text using the regex `/(.*)On.*wrote:.*/m` so this will obviously be a problem for non-English users.


Dependencies
------------

```console
sudo gem install bundler
git clone https://github.com/panicinc/burnside
cd burnside
bundle install --deployment
```
	
Twitter Application
-------------------
Create a new [Twitter Application](https://dev.twitter.com/apps/new) and get its consumer key and secret. Then, authorize it within your account to make use of it.

Configuration
-------------

Copy the .sample files and rename them. For these instructions we'll assume you make a configuration set named "PanicGWTest". You should end up with the following files:

- PanicGWTest.header.erb
- PanicGWTest.html.erb
- PanicGWTest.txt.erb
- PanicGWTest.yml

Fill in the details of the .yml file with the OAuth information you got when you created and authorized your application.

- The `mail.delivery` sections contains basic IMAP authentication details. 

- `to:` should be the email address that will receive the messages generated by `fetch.rb`. 

- `mailbox` is the mail account/alias that messages will be "from". An agent's reply will be sent here.

- The `auth_token` field should contain a randomly generated string of any length. An easy way to make one on Mac OS is with

    dd if=/dev/urandom count=4 2>/dev/null | openssl dgst -sha1
	
Usage
-----

To bridge your tweets to email you'll run bin/fetch.rb as follows

	./bin/fetch.rb -c config/PanicGWTest.yml
	
This task could be run via cron like

	*/5 * * * * cd $HOME/burnside; ./bin/fetch.rb -c config/PanicGWTest.yml
	
To handle incoming email, you'll need to setup Procmail. There's a sample recipe in the config folder. Alternatively, you could write a script that accesses your IMAP inbox and then pipe messages through `tweet.rb`. Frankly, if you don't already have Procmail setup then this might be a less painful approach.

Caveats
-------

Burnside was written to be used with Apple Mail, so there are a few assumptions about how it formats emails.
